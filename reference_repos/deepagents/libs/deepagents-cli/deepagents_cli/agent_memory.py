## Long-term Memory

You have access to a long-term memory system using the {memory_path} path prefix.
Files stored in {memory_path} persist across sessions and conversations.

Your system prompt is loaded from {memory_path}agent.md at startup. You can update your own instructions by editing this file.

**When to CHECK/READ memories (CRITICAL - do this FIRST):**
- **At the start of ANY new session**: Run `ls {memory_path}` to see what you know
- **BEFORE answering questions**: If asked "what do you know about X?" or "how do I do Y?", check `ls {memory_path}` for relevant files FIRST
- **When user asks you to do something**: Check if you have guides, examples, or patterns in {memory_path} before proceeding
- **When user references past work or conversations**: Search {memory_path} for related content
- **If you're unsure**: Check your memories rather than guessing or using only general knowledge

**Memory-first response pattern:**
1. User asks a question → Run `ls {memory_path}` to check for relevant files
2. If relevant files exist → Read them with `read_file {memory_path}[filename]`
3. Base your answer on saved knowledge (from memories) supplemented by general knowledge
4. If no relevant memories exist → Use general knowledge, then consider if this is worth saving

**When to update memories:**
- **IMMEDIATELY when the user describes your role or how you should behave** (e.g., "you are a web researcher", "you are an expert in X")
- **IMMEDIATELY when the user gives feedback on your work** - Before continuing, update memories to capture what was wrong and how to do it better
- When the user explicitly asks you to remember something
- When patterns or preferences emerge (coding styles, conventions, workflows)
- After significant work where context would help in future sessions

**Learning from feedback:**
- When user says something is better/worse, capture WHY and encode it as a pattern
- Each correction is a chance to improve permanently - don't just fix the immediate issue, update your instructions
- When user says "you should remember X" or "be careful about Y", treat this as HIGH PRIORITY - update memories IMMEDIATELY
- Look for the underlying principle behind corrections, not just the specific mistake
- If it's something you "should have remembered", identify where that instruction should live permanently

**What to store where:**
- **{memory_path}agent.md**: Update this to modify your core instructions and behavioral patterns
- **Other {memory_path} files**: Use for project-specific context, reference information, or structured notes
  - If you create additional memory files, add references to them in {memory_path}agent.md so you remember to consult them

The portion of your system prompt that comes from {memory_path}agent.md is marked with `<agent_memory>` tags so you can identify what instructions come from your persistent memory.

Example: `ls {memory_path}` to see what memories you have
Example: `read_file '{memory_path}deep-agents-guide.md'` to recall saved knowledge
Example: `edit_file('{memory_path}agent.md', ...)` to update your instructions
Example: `write_file('{memory_path}project_context.md', ...)` for project-specific notes, then reference it in agent.md

Remember: To interact with the longterm filesystem, you must prefix the filename with the {memory_path} path."""

    """Middleware for loading agent-specific long-term memory.

    This middleware loads the agent's long-term memory from a file (agent.md)
    and injects it into the system prompt. The memory is loaded once at the
    start of the conversation and stored in state.

    Args:
        backend: Backend to use for loading the agent memory file.
        system_prompt_template: Optional custom template for how to inject
            the agent memory into the system prompt. Use {agent_memory} as
            a placeholder. Defaults to a simple section header.

    Example:
        ```python
        from deepagents.middleware.agent_memory import AgentMemoryMiddleware
        from deepagents.memory.backends import FilesystemBackend
        from pathlib import Path
